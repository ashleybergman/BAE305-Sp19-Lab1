# Lab 1-Introduction, DC Components and Lab Equipment
# By: Ashley Bergman 

# Summary
One goal of this lab was to learn about the types of lab equipment we will be using this semester and how to properly operate them. The equipment we learned to use included a Digital Multimeter (DMM), an Oscilloscope, a Function Generator, and a Direct Current Power Supply. During the lab we used the fluke and generic DMM to measure resistances of given resistors, measure capacitances of given capacitors, used the DC power supply to read given voltages on a DMM, and used the function generator to observe different sine waves. The other goal of this lab was to learn to use GitHub for team collaborations and lab reports in the future. 

# Materials
Cables, four resistors, four capacitors, proto board.

# Assembly Procedures
1. For each resistor given, determine its actual resistance using a fluke and generic DMM.
2. For each capacitor given, determine its actual capacitance using a fluke and generic DMM.
3. Using the DC Power supply, set the output of V1 and V2 to +1.5V, +5.0V, +7.5V, and +12.0V and measure each of these using the DMM and cables. 
4. Use the proto board, function generator, and oscilloscope and set it to produce a 2kHz sine wave. Observe the wave and measure the amplitude and frequency 5 different ways: by counting squares on the oscilloscope, by using the movable cursors on the oscilloscope, by using the measurement features of the oscilloscope, and by using a fluke DMM and generic DMM.
